Some info before you start our analysis. 

Key are the notes, so we have C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A# and B
Mode we have Major or minor that represents intervals of chords or keys
with that's set. let's see our results.

What can we see:
Total streams on Spotify;
Total main artist, this counts only the principle of the music, without feat;
Total songs in this data set;
Total song with feat;
Artist selector, here you can put a favorite artist and see his data, or clear the cell and see the mean of all tha artist.
Famous music of each artist in a dataset

Those cells just show all the content, without separating for each artist. ( Maybe in a future i refresh it ).

All the six radars show some specific point between artist, we pick the top 4 streaming artist and then we compare with an artist that you like, 
comparing all the specific details in a music, like speechness, energy, etc.

In a right-side, we have ou Key notes, they mean what are the preferences of the artist in creating a music with each Key.

and then, our top 25 artist stream, we sum all the streaming counts for those artist and we put in a filter from the top to bottom.

and for last we have out mean time durantion of song for the top 15 artist.
